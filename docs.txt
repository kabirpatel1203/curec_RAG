NER Phase:

Input: "Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension."
NER Output: ["type 2 diabetes", "hypertension"]


RAG Phase:

The NER terms are passed into the retrieval component to pull related codes from the ICD-10 database or similar.
Retrieve relevant documents or code suggestions (e.g., E11.9 for "type 2 diabetes" and I10 for "hypertension").


Generation Phase::

The generative model combines the retrieved data with the original medical terms to suggest the ICD-10 codes, highlighting the medical terms identified.
Output: "For 'type 2 diabetes' the suggested ICD-10 code is E11.9. For 'hypertension', the recommended code is I10."
Tools to Use:
Hugging Face Transformers: Pre-trained NER models (e.g., SciBERT, POSOS).
FAISS or ElasticSearch: For efficient document retrieval in the RAG pipeline.
icd10-cm Python library: For ICD-10 lookup during the retrieval phase.
By combining NER with RAG, you enhance the ability to extract relevant medical terms and generate highly accurate and contextually-grounded code recommendations.
